      <h3>Converting to binary</h3>

      <p>
        Consider the number $19$. If we want to convert it to binary, we want to
        find the largest power of two ($2^x$). In this case, that is $2^4 = 16$.
        We can use this to construct a table of values for all of the powers of
        2 from $2^4$ to $2^0$.
      </p>

      <table>
        <tr>
          <th>Power of 2 ($x$)</th>
          <td>4</td>
          <td>3</td>
          <td>2</td>
          <td>1</td>
          <td>0</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <th>$2^x$</th>
          <td>16</td>
          <td>8</td>
          <td>4</td>
          <td>2</td>
          <td>1</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <th>Fits in</th>
          <td></td>
          <td></td>
          <td></td>
          <td></td>
          <td></td>
        </tr>
      </table>

      <p>
        From here, we can see that we can remove $16$ (leaving $3$), which we
        will note as a $1$ in the first column of the last row. We can repeat
        this process. Neither $8$ nor $4$ fit in $3$, so write $0$ in their
        columns. $2$ and $1$ fits in, so we write $1$ in their columns. Now we
        have this table:
      </p>

      <table>
        <tr>
          <th>Power of 2 ($x$)</th>
          <td>4</td>
          <td>3</td>
          <td>2</td>
          <td>1</td>
          <td>0</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <th>$2^x$</th>
          <td>16</td>
          <td>8</td>
          <td>4</td>
          <td>2</td>
          <td>1</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <th>Fits in</th>
          <td>1</td>
          <td>0</td>
          <td>0</td>
          <td>1</td>
          <td>1</td>
        </tr>
      </table>

      <p>
        If we read that from left to right, we will get the binary
        representation, $10011$.
      </p>

      <h3>Converting from binary</h3>

      <p>
        Converting from binary back to decimal is significantly simpler.
        Consider the table we created before:
      </p>

      <table>
        <tr>
          <th>Power of 2 ($x$)</th>
          <td>4</td>
          <td>3</td>
          <td>2</td>
          <td>1</td>
          <td>0</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <th>$2^x$</th>
          <td>16</td>
          <td>8</td>
          <td>4</td>
          <td>2</td>
          <td>1</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <th>Fits in</th>
          <td>1</td>
          <td>0</td>
          <td>0</td>
          <td>1</td>
          <td>1</td>
        </tr>
      </table>

      <p>
        The bottom number in <i>Fits in</i> depicts the number of times the base
        ($2^x$) can fit into the number. To convert it back, we can simply
        multiply each number by the base, and add them all together.
      </p>

      $$16 \times 1 + 8 \times 0 + 4 \times 0 + 2 \times 1 + 1 \times 1 = 19$$

      <h2>Octal</h2>

      <h3>Converting to octal</h3>

      <p>
        The process of converting to octal is very similar to converting to
        binary. Again, we want to find the largest number that matches $8^x$.
        Taking the examples from before, we can see that $8^1 = 8$ is the
        largest number that fits in $19$. We can construct a table of values for
        all of the powers of 8 from $8^1$ to $8^0$.
      </p>

      <table>
        <tr>
          <th>Power of 8 ($x$)</th>
          <td>1</td>
          <td>0</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <th>$8^x$</th>
          <td>8</td>
          <td>1</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <th>Fits in</th>
          <td></td>
          <td></td>
        </tr>
      </table>

      <p>
        Note that the largest multiple of $8$ that fits into $19$ is $16$. So,
        we need to note the multiplier in the first column, which is $2$. This
        leaves a remainder of $3$, which is a multiple of $1$, so we should also
        note it.
      </p>

      <table>
        <tr>
          <th>Power of 8 ($x$)</th>
          <td>1</td>
          <td>0</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <th>$8^x$</th>
          <td>8</td>
          <td>1</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <th>Fits in</th>
          <td>2</td>
          <td>3</td>
        </tr>
      </table>

      <h3>Converting from Octal</h3>

      <p>
        To convert from octal to decimal, we can simply multiply each number by
        $8^x$ and add them together.
      </p>

      $$8 \times 2 + 1 \times 3 = 19$$

      <h2>Hexadecimal</h2>

      <p>
        Hexadecimal are converted in the same way that octal numbers are
        converted. The only difference is that the base is $16$ instead of $8$.
      </p>
